## User Stories

<!--
IMPORTANT: Each story must be small enough to complete in ONE focused coding session.
If a story is too large, break it into smaller stories.

Format each story with VERIFIABLE acceptance criteria:

### US-1: [Story Title]
**Description:** As a [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, verifiable criterion - e.g., "API returns 200 for valid input"]
- [ ] [Another verifiable criterion - e.g., "Error message displayed for invalid email"]
- [ ] Typecheck/lint passes
- [ ] [If UI] Verify in browser

BAD criteria (too vague): "Works correctly", "Is fast", "Handles errors"
GOOD criteria: "Response time < 200ms", "Returns 404 for missing resource", "Form shows inline validation"
-->

### Non-Functional Requirements
<!--
Performance, security, scalability requirements:
- NFR-1: [Requirement - e.g., "Response time < 500ms for 95th percentile"]
- NFR-2: [Requirement - e.g., "Support 100 concurrent users"]
-->

## Implementation Phases

<!-- Break work into 2-4 incremental milestones Ralph can complete one at a time -->

### Phase 1: [Foundation/Setup]
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]
- **Verification:** `[command to verify phase 1]`

### Phase 2: [Core Implementation]
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]
- **Verification:** `[command to verify phase 2]`

### Phase 3: [Integration/Polish]
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]
- **Verification:** `[command to verify phase 3]`

<!-- Add Phase 4 if needed for complex features -->

## Definition of Done

This feature is complete when:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria in user stories pass
- [ ] All implementation phases verified
- [ ] Tests pass: `[verification command]`
- [ ] Types/lint check: `[verification command]`
- [ ] Build succeeds: `[verification command]`

## Ralph Loop Command

<!-- Generated at finalization with phases and escape hatch -->

```bash
/ralph-loop "Implement Implement 24F-2NT parser per spec at docs/specs/implement-24f-2nt-parser.md

PHASES:
1. [Phase 1 name]: [tasks] - verify with [command]
2. [Phase 2 name]: [tasks] - verify with [command]
3. [Phase 3 name]: [tasks] - verify with [command]

VERIFICATION (run after each phase):
- [test command]
- [lint/typecheck command]
- [build command]

ESCAPE HATCH: After 20 iterations without progress:
- Document what's blocking in the spec file under 'Implementation Notes'
- List approaches attempted
- Stop and ask for human guidance

Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when all phases pass verification." --max-iterations 30 --completion-promise "COMPLETE"
```
